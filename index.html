			<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
			<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
				<ul>
					<li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
					<li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2>What you should already know</h2>
			<p>
				This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
				<ul>
					<li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
					<li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
					<li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
		<header><h2>Hello world</h2></header>
		<div>
			<p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
			<code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");</code>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="main-section" id="Variables">
		<header><h2>Variables</h2></header>
		<div>
			<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
			<p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
			<p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
		<header><h2>Declaring Variables</h2></header>
		<div>
			<p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
			<p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
			<code>var x = 42.</code>

			<p>With the keyword const. For example,</p>
			<code>const x = 42.</code>


			<p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
			<p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
			<code>let y = 13.</code>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
		<header><h2>Global Variables</h2></header>
		<div>
			<p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
			<p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
			<p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
			<p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
			<code>x = 42.</code>
